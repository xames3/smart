Studying, Mentorship, And Resourceful Teaching
===============================================================================

**S**\tudying, **M**\entorship, **A**\nd **R**\esourceful **T**\eaching, SMART
for short is my personal portfolio website which I intend to use as my primary
source of teaching and sharing thoughts and experiments.

The website and this complementary repository serves as:

- **Digital Portfolio.** Showcasing my projects in AI, ML, and Software
  Development.
- **Pedagogy.** Mostly with blogs, references, and tutorial posts sharing
  insights into AI and Open Science.

To learn more about this, visit the `smart <https://smart.mes3.dev>`_
website.
