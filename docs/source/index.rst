    A journey of studying, mentorship, and resourceful teaching

Hello hello!

I'm **Akshay**, an Adjunct Professor, AI Engineer, and passionate open-source
contributor. This corner of the internet is my space to explore the fascinating
intersection of technology, learning, and storytelling, and I hope it can be a
useful place for you, too. Here. I share my work, my "aha!" moments, and my
journey through the worlds of AI, Software Development, and Open Source.

I've a special interest in natural language processing, reinforcement
learning, and numerical computing, which I've explored through my personal
projects. I'm also committed to contributing to the `NASA's Open Science`_
mission, promoting transparent, reproducible, and inclusive research.

.. _open-source:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open source
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I :octicon:`heart-fill;1em;sd-text-danger mr-0` Open Source!

For me, it is more than a philosophy. It is my personal reminder to make my
learnings, experiences, and knowledge free and accessible, breaking down
cultural and digital barriers and inviting collaboration across disciplines and
borders. My belief in open collaboration has led me to contribute and work at
some amazing research labs.

I've worked on a diverse range of projects, from building performant machine
learning models to crafting efficient numerical computing libraries. My
projects reflect both technical depth and a passion for education.

        :octicon:`flame` Writing PyTorch from Scratch
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        A maximally minimal auto-differentiation and tensor library written in
        **pure** Python.

    .. grid-item-card:: Why write xsNumPy?
        :link: projects/xsnumpy

        :octicon:`beaker` Building NumPy in pure Python
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        A minimalist re-implementation of core NumPy features re-built in
        **pure** Python.

Beyond these, I've had the opportunity to speak at tech meetups and
conferences, sharing insights on my projects, AI, Open Science, and the inner
workings of numerical computing frameworks.

.. _teaching-philosophy:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Teaching philosophy
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I wholeheartedly believe that true mastery comes from sharing knowledge.
Whether it is breaking down complex machine learning algorithms or explaining
the nuances of AI, I find joy in making technical concepts relatable and easy
to grasp. Early in my Software Engineering career, I heard a quote...

.. epigraph::

    If you want to master something, teach it.

    -- Richard Feynman

And I absolutely fell in love with this idea. Soon I realised you really can't
call yourself an SME (`Subject-matter expert`_) until you can teach it to
those who likely know nothing about it (or very little), and are willing to
entertain questions from people learning at that initial frame of reference.
Thus began my journey into teaching. Although my approach of teaching has
evolved over the past few years, adapting to the needs of my environment,
students, and time.

.. _purpose-and-vision:

Purpose and vision
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This website is more than my portfolio; it's a living project where I'd like
the technology and education to grow together. Through this website, I hope to
build a community where curiosity is the only prerequisite. A place where we
can learn, teach, and grow alongside each other.

Ultimately, my goal is to use this corner on the internet to bridge the gap
between collaboration and education, building tools, and sharing ideas.

.. _lets-connect:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let's connect
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm always open to conversations about AI, teaching, open source, or just a
casual chat about life. I'd love to hear from you. It doesn't need to be just
about the tech either; I'm a huge film nerd and I enjoy memes!! If you are
also passionate about films or want to share something funny, feel free to
reach out or send a recommendation or two.

I'm not on social media, but I'm always reachable via
:email:`email <xa@mes3.dev>` or via
`LinkedIn <https://www.linkedin.com/in/xames3>`_.
