   Harnessing Studying, Mentorship, And Resourceful Teaching to drive
   innovation. Okay... now that's SMART!

Hello hello!

I'm **Akshay** (/uh-k-ʃ-æ/), an Adjunct Professor at National Louis University,
AI Engineer, and open-source contributor dedicated to the intersection of
technology and learning. This corner of the internet serves both as a digital
portfolio, showcasing my work, and a space where I share my learning and
teaching experiences in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Software
Development, Scientific Computing, and Open Science.

Whilst most of my work revolves around building tools that push the boundaries
of technology while keeping accessibility in mind, I've a special interest in
reinforcement learning, numerical computing, and natural language processing,
which I've explored through my personal projects. I'm also committed to
contributing to the `NASA Open Science`_ mission, promoting transparent,
reproducible, and inclusive research.

With Open science, I often do Open Source. For me, it is more than a
philosophy. It's my personal reminder to make my learnings, experiences, and
knowledge free and accessible, breaking down the cultural and digital barriers
and inviting collaboration across disciplines and borders.

Personal projects
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Over the years, I've worked on a diverse range of personal projects, from
building sophisticated AI models to crafting efficient numerical computing
libraries. My projects do reflect both technical expertise and my passion for
education. Some key highlights of my projects include:

- **xsNumpy & SlowTorch.** Lightweight educational libraries inspired by
  `NumPy`_ and `PyTorch`_, built to simplify complex concepts for learners and
  researchers alike. These were created as educational tools for scientific
  computing.

  :doc:`SlowTorch <projects/slowtorch>` |chvrn|

- **Reinforcement Learning.** An AI-driven Snake game including the environment
  built in `Pygame`_, featuring a modular agent and optimised reinforcement
  learning strategies.

Beyond these, I've had the opportunity to speak at tech meetups and
conferences, sharing insights on my projects, AI, open science, and the inner
workings of numerical computing frameworks. These experiences have strengthened
my resolve to not only build innovative tools but also inspire and empower
others through education.

Passion for teaching
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teaching is not just something I do, it's a fundamental part of how I approach
technology. I wholeheartedly believe that true mastery of something comes from
sharing knowledge. Whether it's breaking down complex AI algorithms or
explaining the nuances of machine learning, I find joy in making technical
concepts accessible and easy to grasp. I believe that technology gains its
true power when its understanding is shared. Early in my Software Engineering
career, I heard a quote...

.. epigraph::

    If you want to master something, teach it.

    -- Richard Feynman

And I absolutely fell in love with this idea. Soon I realised you really
can't call yourself an SME (`Subject-matter expert`_) until you can teach it
who likely know nothing about it (or very little), and are willing to entertain
the questions from people learning at that initial frame of reference. Thus
began my journey into teaching. Although my approach when it comes to teaching
or my teaching philosophy to put it simply, has evolved over the past few
years, adapting to the needs of my environment, students and time. It is rooted
in three core principles:

- **Learning by building.** Encouraging hands-on projects as a way to solidify
  or reinforce abstract concepts and theoretical knowledge.
- **Clarity through simplicity.** Distilling complex ideas into simple,
  digestible explanations without compromising depth.
- **Inclusive knowledge.** Ensuring educational resources are open,
  transparent, and available to all, thus aligning with my open source vision.

Why this website?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This website is more than just a portfolio, it's a dynamic little space where
I blend my passion for technology and education. Through this website, I hope
to build a community where technology meets education, and where we learn,
teach, and grow together. I'm hoping to achieve the following:

- **Showcasing projects.** Highlighting my work in AI, scientific computing,
  and software development.
- **Teaching platform.** Offering blog posts, tutorials, and deep dives into
  AI, RAG systems, reinforcement learning, and more.
- **Collaboration.** For students, researchers, developers, and learners who
  share a curiosity for pushing the frontiers of tech.

Ultimately, my goal is to use this personal corner or rather this online
platform to bridge the gap between collaboration and education, building tools,
sharing ideas, and helping others grow alongside me.
