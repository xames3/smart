Hello hello!

I'm **Akshay**, an Adjunct Professor, AI Engineer, and passionate open-source
contributor. This corner on the internet is my space to explore the fascinating
intersection of technology, learning, and storytelling, and I hope it can be a
useful place for you too.

Here, I intend to share my work, my "aha!" moments, and my journey through the
worlds of AI, Software Development, and Open Source. I've a special interest
in natural language processing and reinforcement learning.

.. _open-source:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open source

I :octicon:`heart-fill;1em;red mr-0` Open Source.

For me, it is more than a philosophy. It is my personal reminder to make my
learnings, experiences, and knowledge free and accessible, breaking down
cultural and digital barriers and inviting collaboration across disciplines and
borders.

My belief in open collaboration has led me to contribute and work at some
amazing research labs.

I've worked on a diverse range of projects, from building performant machine
learning models to crafting numerical computing libraries. My projects reflect
both technical depth and a passion for education.

.. grid:: 2

    .. grid-item-card::

        .. repository:: xames3/slowtorch

        A subset of core PyTorch features re-built in pure Python.

    .. grid-item-card::

        .. repository:: xames3/xsnumpy

        An experimental re-implementation of a few NumPy features in Python.

Beyond these, I've had the opportunity to speak at tech meetups and
conferences, sharing insights on my projects, AI, Open Science, and the inner
workings of numerical computing frameworks.

Teaching philosophy

I wholeheartedly believe that true mastery comes from sharing knowledge.
Whether it is breaking down complex machine learning algorithms or explaining
the nuances of software design, I find joy in making technical concepts
relatable and easy to grasp.

Early in my software engineering career, I heard a quote from Richard Feynman.

.. epigraph::

    If you want to master something, teach it.

    -- Richard Feynman

And I absolutely fell in love with this idea. Soon I realised you really can't
call yourself an SME (`Subject-matter expert`_) until you can teach it to
those who likely know nothing about it (or very little), and are willing to
entertain questions from people learning at that initial frame of reference.

Thus began my journey into teaching.

Although my approach of mentoring has evolved over the past few years, adapting
to the needs of my environment, students/mentees, and time which is why I've
this website. This website is more than my portfolio; it's a living project
where I'd like the technology and education to grow together.

Ultimately, my goal is to use this corner to bridge the gap between
collaboration and education, building tools, and sharing ideas.

Let's connect

I'm not on social media, but I'm always open to conversations about AI,
teaching, open source, or just a casual chat about life. I'd love to hear from
you. It doesn't need to be just about the tech either.

Also, I'm a huge film nerd and I enjoy memes.
