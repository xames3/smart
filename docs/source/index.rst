    A journey of studying, mentorship, and resourceful teaching

Hello hello!

I'm **Akshay** (/uh-k-ʃ-æ/), an Adjunct Professor at National Louis
University, AI Engineer, and open-source contributor dedicated to the
intersection of technology and learning. This corner of the internet serves
both as a digital portfolio, showcasing my work, and a space where I share my
learning and teaching experiences in the fields of Artificial Intelligence,
Software Development, Scientific Computing, and Open Science.

Whilst most of my work revolves around building tools that push the boundaries
of technology and keeping accessibility in mind, I've a special interest in
reinforcement learning, numerical computing, and natural language processing,
which I've explored through my personal projects. I'm also committed to
contributing to the `NASA Open Science`_ mission, promoting transparent,
reproducible, and inclusive research.

Alongside Open Science, I practise open source. For me, it is more than a
philosophy. It is my personal reminder to make my learnings, experiences, and
knowledge free and accessible, breaking down cultural and digital barriers and
inviting collaboration across disciplines and borders.

Personal projects

Over the years, I've worked on a diverse range of personal projects, from
building AI systems to crafting efficient numerical computing libraries. My
projects reflect both technical depth and a passion for education. Some
highlights include:

- **xsNumPy & SlowTorch.** Lightweight educational libraries inspired by
  `NumPy`_ and `PyTorch`_, built to simplify complex concepts for learners and
  researchers.

  :doc:`SlowTorch <projects/slowtorch>` |chvrn|

- **Reinforcement Learning.** An AI-driven Snake game including the environment
  built in `Pygame`_, featuring a modular agent and optimised reinforcement
  learning strategies.

Beyond these, I've had the opportunity to speak at tech meetups and
conferences, sharing insights on projects, AI, Open Science, and the inner
workings of numerical computing frameworks. These experiences have strengthened
my resolve to not only build innovative tools but also inspire and empower
others through education.

Teaching philosophy
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teaching isn't just something I do, it is a fundamental part of how I approach
technology. I wholeheartedly believe that true mastery comes from sharing
knowledge. Whether it is breaking down complex AI algorithms or explaining the
nuances of machine learning, I find joy in making technical concepts accessible
and easy to grasp. Early in my Software Engineering career, I heard a quote...

.. epigraph::

    If you want to master something, teach it.

    -- Richard Feynman

And I absolutely fell in love with this idea. Soon I realised you really can't
call yourself an SME (`Subject-matter expert`_) until you can teach it to
those who likely know nothing about it (or very little), and are willing to
entertain questions from people learning at that initial frame of reference.
Thus began my journey into teaching. Although my approach or my teaching
philosophy to put it simply has evolved over the past few years, adapting to
the needs of my environment, students, and time. It is rooted in three core
principles:

- **Learning by building.** Encouraging hands-on projects as a way to solidify
  or reinforce abstract concepts and theoretical knowledge.
- **Clarity through simplicity.** Distilling complex ideas into simple,
  digestible explanations without compromising depth.
- **Inclusive knowledge.** Ensuring educational resources are open,
  transparent, and available to all, aligning with my open source vision.

Purpose and vision
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This website is more than just a portfolio, it is a dynamic space where I blend
technology and education. Through this website, I hope to build a community
where technology meets education, and where we learn, teach, and grow together.
I'm hoping to achieve the following:

- **Showcasing projects.** Highlighting my work in AI, scientific computing,
  and software development.
- **Teaching platform.** Offering blog posts, tutorials, and deep dives into
  AI, RAG systems, reinforcement learning, and more.
- **Collaboration.** For students, researchers, developers, and learners who
  share a curiosity for pushing the frontiers of technology.

Ultimately, my goal is to use my personal corner or this platform to bridge
the gap between collaboration and education, building tools, sharing ideas,
and helping others grow alongside me.

I'm always open to conversations about AI, teaching, open source, or just a
casual chat about life. I'd love to hear from you. It doesn't need to be just
about the tech either; I'm a huge film buff! If you are also passionate about
films, feel free to reach out or send a recommendation or two.
