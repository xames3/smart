- **Duration.** 10 weeks
- **Language.** Language-agnostic (`Python`_ as an experimenting language)

.. note::

    The course code and title may vary from uni to uni. This is an entry-level
    foundational course offered in most if not all schools to students in
    their freshman year. This course is a prerequisite for almost all the
    software development, machine learning and computer science courses.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Programming is more than writing lines of code. It's about learning how to
think like a problem-solver and breaking down complex ideas into smaller,
manageable pieces. In this course, we won't just learn and memorise syntaxes
or chase after clever one-liners or cheeky hacks; we'll focus on building a
solid foundation, one that will empower you to pick up any programming
language in the future. Although Python will be our guiding tool due to its
simplicity and rich library support, the real goal here is to make you
comfortable with the concepts of programming |dash| the logic, structures, and
the core paradigms |dash| so that languages like `C++`_, `Java`_, or
`JavaScript`_ feel less like mountains to climb and more like familiar
landspaces.

By the end of this 10-week journey, you'll be able to solve small, everyday
problems with code by automating repetitive tasks, building simple programs, or
even kickstarting a personal project you've always dreamed about. More
importantly, you'll have the mindset and confidence to build something from
scratch, break it, fix it, and make it better!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objectives
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By the end of this course, you will:

- develop a programmer's mindset, cultivate a logical problem-solving way of
  thinking that extends beyond writing code.
- think beyond the syntax and learn not just how to write code, but why
  certain approaches work better than others.
- master fundamental concepts |dash| variables, loops, conditionals,
  functions, and objects |dash| core constructs you'll find in nearly every
  programming language.
- write clear, structured, and maintainable code by learning how to organise
  your thoughts into clean, efficient, and reusable code, a skill that's super important for both personal projects and team collaborations.
- understand language-agnostic principles by recognising the patterns that
  underline all programming languages, so you can easily transition to other
  languages like C++, `Rust`_, or JavaScript down the road.
- solve problems by applying programming to small, personal tasks like
  automating a daily chore, parsing a text file, or building a basic to-do app.
- prepare yourself for future courses and industry workloads by building a
  strong foundation that will make advanced topics like algorithms, data
  structures, AI, and cloud computing far less intimidating.
- learn to Google your way through any debugging session!!!

This course isn't just about **"getting the right answers."** It's about
learning how to ask or rather Google the right questions.

Structure
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is the week-by-week breakdown of how we will proceed through our
curriculum.

Week 01
===============================================================================

.. rubric:: Programming Mindset or Thinking in Code
    :heading-level: 3

Since it's the first week, we won't dive headfirst into coding but rather
cheekily rewire ourselves to think like a programmer. Before writing fancy
algorithms, we need to learn how to break problems into smaller, logical steps.
This week is all about developing a programming mentality.

.. rubric:: What we'll cover
    :heading-level: 3

- **What is programming?**

  - Understanding programming as a problem-solving tool.
  - How computers **"think"**? Basics of how code gets executed
    (interpreted vs. compiled languages).
  - Why programming is more about logic than language?

- **Thinking like a machine**

  - Decomposing problems: breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps.
  - What an algorithm (step-by-step solution) means?

- **Your first program**

  - Writing a hello world program in multiple languages (primarily Python).
  - Understanding similarities and differences in semantics and syntaxes
    across multiple languages.
  - Interpreting error messages and searching for solutions on the
    internet.

- **Building blocks of code**

  - Introduction to fundamental concepts of programming like variables,
    data types, etc. and their similarities with Maths.

.. rubric:: Interactive Hands-On Lab
    :heading-level: 3

- Compare and dissect various programming blocks for the same code across
    multiple programming languages.

.. rubric:: Reflection and Homework
    :heading-level: 3

- **Reflect.** Whatever you learned today about programming in any way,
    shape, or form.
- **Reflect.** What you think about **"step-by-step thinking"** and compare
    how you would normally solve a problem?
- **Homework.** Find a simple program that solved a problem |dash| bring
    at least one example to share next week (it can be anything from a simple
    algorithm or someone's personal project you found online).

Week 02
===============================================================================

.. rubric:: Variables, Data Types, and The Art of Naming
    :heading-level: 3

This week, we'll dive deeper into one of the most essential concepts in
programming |dash| variables |dash| and uncover the art and science behind how
we store and manipulate data.

But here's the twist: this isn't just about learning what a variable is |dash|
it's about truly understanding how data moves and lives within your programs.
A variable isn't just a "box" or "placeholder" for holding information |dash|
it's a label for something deeper. We'll explore how variables work behind the
scenes, how memory allocation plays a role, and why naming things in
programming is both an art form and a crucial skill for writing clean,
meaningful code.

.. rubric:: What we'll cover
    :heading-level: 3

- **What exactly is a Variable?**

  - Variables as labels for data stored in memory.
  - Mutable vs. Immutable types.
  - Dynamic typing in Python vs. Static typing in other languages.

- **Demystifying data types**

  - Primitive data types: Integers, Floating-point numbers, Strings, and
    Booleans.
  - Composite data types: Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries.
  - Data Type conversions (type casting).

- **The art of naming variables**

  - Why meaningful names matter |dash| code is read more than it's written.
  - Best practices and naming conventions (Python and other languages).
  - Code clarity |dash| why readability always wins.

- **Working with variables**

  - Assigning and reassigning values to a variable.

.. rubric:: Interactive Hands-On Lab
    :heading-level: 3

- Design a simple **"Budget Tracker"** program where users input their daily
  expenses (items and costs), and the program then calculates the total money
  spent. The outcome of this lab is to learn how to use meaningful variable
  names and start thinking about how to store data for future use.

.. rubric:: Reflection and Homework
    :heading-level: 3

- **Reflect.** What was the most challenging part about naming your
  variables?
- **Homework.** Find a small open-source project (possibly Python for
  simplicity) on GitHub. Look at how the developer has named their variables
  and the data structures (data types). Bring at least one good and one bad
  example to discuss in class next week.
- **Homework.** Refactor the code from W1 by giving all the variables
  clearer, more descriptive and appropriate names according to your way.

.. admonition:: Extra credit!

    Find at least two unique and funny memes or developer stories about the
    importance of meaningful variable names. The memes should be different from
    what we've seen during the class.
