This article is more than just a collection of syllabi; it's my deep and
personal endeavour. As of writing this, I reflect back on my journey as a
student, giving a tribute to the mentors who lit the path ahead of me, and a
commitment to those who will one day walk a similar road.

For those who know me personally know that I've been super duper fortunate to
have crossed paths with some truly amazing teachers and mentors. These
individuals taught me to think critically and ask the right questions. But not
every moment was full of rainbows and sunshines. I've also navigated moments
of confusion, of wishing the curriculum had been clearer, more connected to
the real-world skills I needed.

This article is my way of bridging that gap.

I've realised this pretty early in my career that the tech industry moves
quite fast and how challenging it can be to step from the world of academia
into the realities of building software and training AI models. Therefore, I'm
crafting these **"ideal"** interpretations of courses not because I claim to
have all the answers, but because I want to offer the kind of structure and
guidance I once wished for. My goal here is simple: to design course outlines
that not only strengthen foundational knowledge but also equip students with
the practical tools and critical mindset needed to thrive in an ever-evolving
landscape.

    Study hard what interests you the most, in the most undisciplined,
    irreverent, and original manner possible

So, to all those reading this, I hope these courses inspire you to learn
fearlessly, just as my mentors inspired me.
