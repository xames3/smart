    Study hard what interests you the most, in the most undisciplined,
    irreverent, and original manner possible -- Richard Feynman

This article is more than just a collection of syllabi, it's a deeply personal
endeavour. I reflect back on my journey as a student, a tribute to the mentors
who lit the path ahead of me, and a commitment to those who will one day walk
a similar road. For those who know me personally know that I've been super
duper fortunate to have crossed paths with some truly amazing teachers and
mentors. These individuals taught me to think critically, ask the right
questions. But not every moment was full of rainbows and sunshines. I've also
navigated moments of confusion, of wishing the curriculum had been clearer,
more connected to the real-world skills I needed.

This article is my way of bridging that gap.

You know what, I've realised this pretty early in my career that the tech
industry moves quite fast and how challenging it can be to step from the world
of academia into the realities of building softwares and training AI models.
Therefore, I'm crafting these **"ideal"** interpretation of my courses not
because I claim to have all the answers, but because I want to offer the kind
of structure and guidance I once wished for. My goal here is simple: to design
course outlines that not only strengthen foundational knowledge but also equip
students with the practical tools and critical mindset needed to thrive in an
ever-evolving landscape.

So, to all those reading this, I hope these courses inspire you to learn
fearlessly, just as my mentors inspired me.

Introduction to Programming
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. note::

    The course code may vary from uni to uni. This is an entry-level
    foundational in most of the schools which students take in their freshman
    year.

- **Duration.** 10 weeks
- **Language.** Language-agnostic (`Python`_ as an experimenting language)

Overview
===============================================================================

Programming is more than writing lines of code. It's about learning how to
think like a problem-solver, breaking down complex ideas into smaller
manageable pieces. In this course, we won't just learn and memorise syntaxes or
chase after clever one-liners or cheeky hacks, we'll focus on building a solid
foundation, one that will empower you to pick up any programming language in
the future. While Python will be our guiding tool due to its simplicity and
rich library support, the real goal here is to make you comfortable with the
concepts of programming |dash| the logic, structures, and the core paradigms,
so that languages like C++, Java, or Javascript feel less like mountains to
climb and more like familiar landspaces.

By the end of this 10 weeks journey, you'll be able to solve small, everyday
problems with code by automating repetitve tasks, building simple programs, or
even kickstarting a personal project you've always dreamed about. More
importantly, you'll have the mindset and confidence to build something from
scratch, break it, fix it, and make it better!

Course objectives
===============================================================================

By the end of this course, you will:

- develop a programmer's mindset, cultivate a logical problem-solving way of
  thinking that extends beyond writing code.
- think beyond the syntax and learn not just how to write code, but why certain
  approaches work better than others.
- master fundamental concepts |dash| variables, loops, conditionals, functions,
  and objects |dash| core constructs you'll find in nearly every programming
  language.
- write clear, structured and maintainable code by learning how to organise
  your thoughts into clean, efficient, and reusable code, a skill that's super
  important for both personal projects and team collaborations.
- understand language-agnostic principles by recognising the patterns that
  underline all programming languages, so you can easily transition to other
  languages like C++, Rust, or Javascript down the road.
- solve problems by applying programming to small, personal tasks like
  automating a daily chore, parsing a text file, or building a basic to-do app.
- prepare yourself for future courses and industry workloads by building a
  strong foundation that will make advanced topics like algorithms, data
  structures, AI, and cloud computing far less intimidating.
- learn to google your way through any debugging session!!!

This course isn't just about "getting the right answers." It's about learning
how to ask or rather google the right questions.

Structure
===============================================================================

Below is the week-by-week breakdown of how we will proceed through our
curriculum.

.. dropdown:: Week One

    .. rubric:: Programming Mindset or Thinking in Code
        :heading-level: 3

    Since its the first week, we won't dive headfirst into coding but rather
    cheekily rewire ourselves to think like a programmer. Before writing fancy
    algorithms, we need to learn how to break problems into smaller, logical
    steps. This week is all about developing a programming mentality.

    **What we'll cover:**

    - What is programming?

      - Understanding programming as a problem-solving tool.
      - How computers "think"? Basics of how code gets executed (interpreted
        vs. compiled languages).
      - Why programming is more about logic than language?

    - Thinking like a machine

      - Decomposing problems: breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps.
      - What an algorithm (step-by-step solution) means?

    - Your first program

      - Writing a hello world program in multiple languages (primarily Python).
      - Understanding similarities and differences in semantics and syntaxes
        across multiple languages.
      - Interpreting error messages and searching for solutions on the
        internet.

    - Building blocks of code

      - Introduction to fundamental concepts of programming like variables
        (identifiers), data types, etc. and their similarities with Maths.

    **Interactive Lab:**

    - Compare and disect various programming blocks for the same code across
      multiple programming languages.

    **Reflection and Homework:**

    - **Reflect.** Whatever you learned today about programming in any way
      shape or form.
    - **Reflect.** What you think about **"step-by-step thinking"** and compare
      how you would normally solve a problem?
    - **Homework.** Find a simple program that solved a problem |dash| bring
      at least one example to share next week (it can be anything from a simple
      algorithm or someone's personal project you found online).
