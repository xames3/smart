One of the best parts of sharing and writing these articles is the
conversations that follow. I've had loads of interesting chats in person and a
few over email, and I've noticed a pattern. A lot of the same questions pop up,
some are esoteric about a topic while others are simply "why?".

But all of them are great questions!

Reasons behind FAQ page
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ever since I transitioned into teaching, some of you have asked about that.
While many have asked about my thoughts on the late 2025 job situation. Some
have even questioned why even I built projects like
:doc:`xsNumPy <../projects/xsnumpy>` and
:doc:`SlowTorch <../projects/slowtorch>` which seems like reinventing the
wheel. And then there are the questions about what my favourite films are and
what I am currently watching... all of which are, again, great questions!

Ever since I met Charlotte, and I've mentioned this several times, I've
realised that you only need to be curious to learn something. Now, on this
page, there's nothing **practical** to learn, but I'd like to honour your
curiosity nonetheless.

To make it easier for everyone, I've put together my answers to your most
frequent questions. This isn't just a list, but it's an extension of my story.
Think of it as some Easter eggs.

    :class-container: site-faq

    So, XAMES3 is my alias and username for online profiles. The first part,
    **XA**, represents my first name, Akshay. The letter *X* is a sound-alike
    for the first syllable, "**Aksh**". Think of the letter "X" on its own, it
    sound similar to "Aksh".

    *A* is a sound-alike for the second syllable, "**ay**" (as in "day").

    So, "**Aksh**" + "**ay**" becomes **X-A**.

    The second part, **MES3**, is a subtle play on my surname, Mestry. *MES* is
    a straightforward representation of the first syllable, "**Mes**". And the
    number **3** represents "**try**". It is not "*try*" as we say in English
    but more like "*tree*".

    So, XAMES3 is just my name spelled out in short. This is called as
    `Gramogram`_ in English. You've used gramograms in your conversations too!
    For example, "c u" is a gramogram for "see you", "JL" is a gramogram for
    "jail", etc.

.. dropdown:: How do you pronounce XAMES3 or XA?
    :class-container: site-faq

    It's literally pronounced as "X-A" or "X-A-Mes-three".

.. dropdown:: What is your role at National Louis University?
