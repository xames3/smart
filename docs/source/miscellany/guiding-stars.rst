   Heartfelt gratitude to the people who shaped my path in AI, Learning, and
   Beyond

Blimey! While writing this article, I paused for a moment to reflect on my
personal achievements and learnings. As I was thinking about most, if not all,
of the significant milestones in my career, from choosing a career path into
the realm of Artificial Intelligence to building this platform, stands a
massive constellation of remarkable individuals who've shaped the person I'm
today. To those prominent figures in my life, this article is more than an
acknowledgment; it is a small tribute to those whose support, wisdom, and
belief in me have fueled my passion for technology, teaching, and open source.

.. admonition:: A note of gratitude

    Like I mentioned, this article is merely a small reflection on my past and
    the people who've critically influenced my academic, personal, and
    professional journey. Although I've shared comprehensive reflections about
    a select few individuals due to a more deeper and personal experience with
    them, the impact of everyone mentioned here is of equal significance.

    Each one of you has shaped the person I'm today, and this article stands
    as a collective token of appreciation or tribute to all your guidance,
    friendship, and support.

Like Gaia, you ground me
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the very core of this journey is my mother, **Sunita**. Like `Gaia`_, the
Earth goddess who gives life to all, my Mum has been the quintessential
foundation of my existence. Mum, your unwavering support and belief during my
highs and lows has been the cornerstone of my ambition. Although I didn't get
to spend a lot of time with you in my early days, you taught me the value of
persistence, the inevitability of hard choices in life, and the importance of
embracing my past.

    My mum and I, back in September of 2022, right after my admission into
    DePaul University at our family home in Enfield

From the moments of comfort at my lowest to the greatest acts of selflessness
at my peak, you have been there, guiding me through it all, keeping me
grounded. I'm happy and content today with my life for the choices you helped
me make. I still remember when I chose the career path to pursue Artificial
Intelligence, a field vast and complex at that time, your encouragement was
the anchor that kept me grounded and disciplined. All those late nights,
sitting at the kitchen table with stacks of programming books, preparing for
the certifications and interviews, you would bring a refreshing cup
of `Masala chai`_, reminding me not to give up but at the same time reminding
me of the importance of sleep and rest is something I dearly miss.

Ever since Father passed, your love has been the very foundation upon which I
stand, and I'm so grateful for every sacrifice you've made to see me grow and
succeed. Mum, you are my Earth, my Gaia, and I am forever thankful for the
depth of your love and the strength of your spirit.

.. _charlotte-my-uma:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charlotte, my Uma
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Charlotte**, though you're no longer with us, your influence is an
indispensable part of who I'm today. Much like `Uma`_'s love for `Shankar`_,
transformed him from a celibate hermit to a householder, your presence in my
life catalyzed a profound change in me. You were the spark, my Uma that
ignited my deeper fascination with technology. I vividly remember you helping
me shed layers of self-doubt and superficiality, guiding me towards a deeper
understanding of who I truly am. It was you who pushed me to question things
and go beyond the surface-level understanding but to understand the
mathematics and logic behind them.

It was because of you, my interest in technology grew with time, and while it
was growing, you reminded me that these technologies aren't just about
algorithms and problem-solving, it is about **impact** they have on our lives.
I remember how you would listen patiently as I rambled about new technologies
or tools, always asking the right questions that made me think harder and dig
deeper. Your encouragement pushed me to think how technology could transform
lives, and more importantly, how I could share that knowledge with others. It
was your faith in my ability as a teacher that made me realize the joy of
sharing knowledge. You often said, *"Akshay, the best way to learn is to
teach."* Those words still echo in my heart every time I stand before a
classroom or mentor someone. In every student I mentor, I see you and it
reminds me of our last conversation...

.. epigraph::

    If you loved me like a child, then live your life like a child. Walk this
    rock like a child. Keep moving forward through calm and storm, I'll always
    be with you Akshay, but in a different form.

    -- Charlotte Parks

Like I said, as Uma's love shaped and transformed Shankar, your love shaped and
transformed me, guiding me into my truest form. It was your belief in me as a
teacher that planted the seed for this very platform. Your spirit lives on in
every tutorial I write, every student I mentor, and every piece of knowledge I
share.

.. _sajiths-guidance-krishnas-wisdom:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sajith's guidance, Krishna's wisdom
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Back in 2017, my professional career took off at `Accenture`_. Accenture, the
company, will always hold a special place in my heart. This is where I was
fortunate to work under **Sajith**'s mentorship. Sajith was the first person
who truly believed in me, not just as a worker, but as someone capable of
achieving great things in AI and Machine Learning. Well, it's been quite a
while since I worked at Accenture, but I remember when I first started, I was
still figuring out my place in the cut-throat corporate world. I was nervous
and frustrated at the same time. But you, Sajith, you saw something in me that
I wasn't sure even existed.

I'll never forget the day you took me for a walk and explained how to look at
the bigger picture, about my life, my career, and relationships. I was indeed
overwhelmed, unsure of myself. But you never gave up on me but pushed me to
grow in ways I hadn't imagined. Although you were my manager, much senior in
the career level, you never treated me any differently. Your approach was
unlike any I had experienced before. I do remember you telling me, *"It's
never about doing things perfectly; it is about learning and evolving along
the way."*

Those simple words taught me a lesson that stayed with me ever since. You
always encouraged me to dive into the deep end, to question things, to
understand the **"why"** behind every decision. And when I struggled, as I
inevitably did, you didn't just offer solutions. You guided me like a mentor,
always patient, always present, but never hovering. Sajith, you were more than
a mentor to me, you were my guide, my `Krishna`_. That guidance is what has
carried me forward in my academic and professional pursuits to this day.

.. _my-supporting-cast:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My Supporting Cast
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

People who are extremely close to me know how much of a cinephile I am. In my
opinion, life, much like a cinema, is not a **solo** thing. Quite often the
spotlight shines on the lead cast, the actors, directors, etc.; the names we
usually tend to remember. But the true magic of cinema lies in the collective
effort of countless individuals who work behind the scenes. Just like a
cinema, with its unsung heroes, the editors, sound designers, VFX artists, and
other crew members who together make a story come alive, my journey has been
shaped by an extraordinary cast of mentors, friends, and supporters.

Whatever you're seeing here on this website, be it my projects, ideas, the
teachings, all of it is a summation of the invaluable contributions and
influence of those who stood besides me, guiding me, and sometimes pushing me
to go beyond my comfort zone. This section of this article is my version of
the end credits. A tribute to all the people whose names may not always be in
the spotlight but whose impact resonates in every line of code I write and
every lesson I share.

And, just like the credits roll long after the cinema's end, this list will
only grow as time goes on. I'm most definitely looking forward to adding more
names to my cinematic universe.

.. note::

    The below list is in alphabetical order solely for my OCD. It doesn't
    imply anything else. Each person on this list holds equal importance for
    me and has had massive influence on my life.

.. _cast-cameron-riddell:

Cameron Riddell
===============================================================================

Cameron, my open science guru and data visualization **maestro**! Although
we've never met in person, our virtual interactions have been nothing less
than transformative. I consider myself to be exceptionally lucky to have you
as my mentor at the early stages of my open science journey. Though we live in
different time zones and states apart, I've never felt that our conversations
are affected by our geographical differences. Despite my experiences working
with data for a few years now, your insights, particularly in the domain of
visualizations, have not only inspired me but also made me critically think
about presenting it effectively. You introduced me to `Edward Tufte`_'s
phenomenal work, a revelation that has since changed the way I approach visual
analysis.

But that's not all I admire about you, Cameron. For me, personally, of all
your skills, your teaching style stands out as the most admirable quality. I
do remember attending one of the `Open Science Trainings`_ and re-learning
`Git`_, of all things! That moment, I learned that no matter how experienced
one might be, there's always room for growth and improvement. Your influence
on me as an educator has been very profound and I'm super grateful for all
your suggestions and advice, knowing that your guidance and insights are
always one message away.

.. _cast-madhavi-rege:

Madhavi Rege
===============================================================================

A professional badass! Madhavi, you've been an exceptional mentor and have a
strong influence in my life. After training under your leadership and
unwavering guidance, I can proudly say that I've rather **mastered** the art of
time and work management. I've been asked on several occasions, how do I
manage my time, do all the things I do, or work on my personal projects amidst
all the other responsibilities I carry, and the answer has always been the
same. It's because of someone I worked with previously.

You nurtured my ability to think critically (take everything on email!), plan
through my schedule meticulously, and execute precisely, qualities which even
today I implement in every project and professional endeavor.

.. _cast-sameer-mathad:

Sameer Mathad
===============================================================================

A pursuer of excellence! Like :ref:`Shilpa <cast-shilpa-musale>`, I met Sameer
while my time at DePaul. Being from the same program, we often shared a lot of
classes together. As of writing this article, our friendship, though
relatively new, has certainly grown into something I truly value. I know
Sameer, I often pull your leg and give you a hard time, often teasing about
your **"goody-two-shoes"** attitude when the whole damn class is struggling to
keep up the pace. But beneath all this teasing, I feel this dynamic blend of
playful banter and mutual respect is what keeps us together.

I never speak of this, but what I really appreciate about you is your quiet
yet firm way of reminding me about the importance of hardwork and discipline.
While I super duper pride myself on being a mentor or perhaps a teacher in
some instances, there were a lot of moments where I felt more like a student,
learning lessons from you. Though our friendship has just begun, there's a lot
more to come, more meaningful conversations to take place, and even more leg
pulling to happen! But behind that chatty humor is a bond built on trust,
respect, and a shared pursuit of growth.

.. _cast-shailesh-kewat:

Shailesh Kewat
===============================================================================

A true friend, gentleman and my steady pillar of support! Looking back at it,
it's funny to see how we became friends during the **"drop"** phase of our
lives. All the time we spent studying together for the tests, although it
didn't pay off as much as we expected it to, I sure made some amazing memories
with you. Shailesh, you've been there with me not only during my moments of
success but also in the moments of doubt.

After losing :ref:`Charlotte <charlotte-my-uma>`, you've been the one person
who constantly insisted that I teach and provided me with everything I needed
to break through my self-doubts. Your guidance on public speaking and community
engagement helped me build this platform and the confidence I have today.

.. _cast-shilpa-musale:

Shilpa Musale
===============================================================================

My beacon of survival and wisdom in the United States! As of writing this
article, `Shilpa`_ and I have known each other for a little over a year now.
But honestly, it doesn't feel like that. We met during my first year of school
in the US, where I really felt overwhelmed, lost, and sometimes even isolated.
But you made me feel safe and welcomed.

Shilpa, you've definitely evolved from a confidante to a mentor-like figure in
my life. I still remember you sharing your stories, recounting your
experiences which mirrored mine as I was struggling through my life and
relationship. For me, those experiences were not just mere stories from your
past but **lessons**, each one with deep wisdom that resonated strongly with
me. You've been my anchor, sharing invaluable advice about career and surviving
through these difficult job trajectories. In my moments of loneliness and
depression, your presence was super reassuring. Whether it was a phone call or
a simple message to check in on me or a spontaneous invitation to your place
for a quick walk and talk, you made sure I never felt alone.

Looking back at those moments, I'm filled with a deep sense of gratitude and
I'm grateful that I found a mentor like you.
