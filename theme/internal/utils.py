"""\
SMART Sphinx Theme Utilities
============================

Author: Akshay Mestry <xa@mes3.dev>
Created on: 21 February, 2025
Last updated on: 20 October, 2025

This module defines a collection of utility functions used for
customising the SMART Sphinx Theme. These utilities focus on enhancing
the post-processing of the generated HTML output, as well as providing
additional support for interactive elements, theme options, and other
dynamic behaviors. The functionality provided includes handling
collapsible table of contents (ToC), scrollspy support, removal of
unnecessary elements, and custom event handling for theme-specific
features.

The goal of this module is to ensure that the SMART Sphinx Theme
produces clean, efficient, and interactive HTML documentation by
leveraging Sphinx's internal APIs and dynamic JavaScript bindings.

.. deprecated:: 19.10.2025

    Use of `website_options` in favour of `html_context`. This removes
    the need of `register_website_options` function.
