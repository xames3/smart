"""\
SMART Sphinx Theme GitHub Repository Directive
==============================================

Author: Akshay Mestry <xa@mes3.dev>

This module defines a custom `repository` directive for the SMART Sphinx
Theme. The directive allows authors to provide details of their GitHub
repository in their documentation.

The `repository` directive is designed to extend reStructuredText (rST)
capabilities by injecting structured metadata about the content, which
can be styled or processed further using Jinja2 templates.

The `repository` directive can be used in reStructuredText documents as
follows::

    .. code-block:: rst

        .. repository:: xames3/smart
            :stars:
            :issues:

The above snippet will be processed and rendered according to the
theme's Jinja2 template, producing a final HTML output.

.. note::

    This directive is exclusive to the SMART Sphinx Theme. If you
    switch to a different theme, the behavior or availability of this
    directive may change. Please refer to the specific theme's
    documentation for further information.
