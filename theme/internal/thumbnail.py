"""\
SMART Sphinx Theme YouTube Thumbnail Directive
==============================================

This module defines a custom `thumbnail` directive for the SMART Sphinx
Theme. The directive allows authors to embed a YouTube video thumbnail
card directly within their documentation.

The `thumbnail` directive is designed to extend reStructuredText (rST)
capabilities by fetching metadata from a YouTube URL and rendering a
styled card.

The `thumbnail` directive can be used in reStructuredText documents as
follows::

    .. thumbnail:: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
        :title: Never Gonna Give You Up
        :channel: Rick Astley

The above snippet will be processed and rendered according to the
theme's Jinja2 template, producing a final HTML output.

.. note::

    This directive is exclusive to the SMART Sphinx Theme. If you
    switch to a different theme, the behavior or availability of this
    directive may change. Please refer to the specific theme's
    documentation for further information.
