"""\
SMART Sphinx Theme YouTube Directive
====================================

Author: Akshay Mestry <xa@mes3.dev>

This module defines a custom `youtube` directive for the SMART Sphinx
Theme. The directive allows authors to embed a YouTube videoâ€”directly
within their documentation.

The `youtube` directive is designed to extend reStructuredText (rST)
capabilities by injecting structured metadata about the content video,
which can be styled or processed further using Jinja2 templates.

The `youtube` directive can be used in reStructuredText documents as
follows::

    .. code-block:: rst

        .. youtube:: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhabJpIPONI

The above snippet will be processed and rendered according to the
theme's Jinja2 template, producing a consistent author card or section
in the final HTML output.

.. note::

    This directive is exclusive to the SMART Sphinx Theme. If you
    switch to a different theme, the behavior or availability of this
    directive may change. Please refer to the specific theme's
    documentation for further information.
